## Proof of concept: known plaintext attack on A5/2 encryption scheme
This is an implementation of a "decryptor" of ciphers generated by the A5/2 encryption scheme. It was a part of my bachelor thesis.

The implementation shows, that having some initial plaintext information, it is possible to decrypt the whole cipher (no matter the length).

The attack is based on "E. Barkan, E. Biham, N. Keller, Instant ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of GSM encrypted communications".
